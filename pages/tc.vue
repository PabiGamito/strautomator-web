                        <p>
                            When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure,

                        <p>
                            Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. We will

                        </p>

                            We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this policy. If your personal information is no longer required,
                            we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you after a certain period. Information stored in the server's access log cannot be removed on-demand, but it will be automatically discarded
                            after 30 days.

                        <p>
                            We use "cookies" to collect information about you and your activity across our site. A cookie is a small piece of data that our website stores on your computer, and accesses each time you visit, so we can understand how

                        <h2 class="mt-6 mb-4">Subscription Plans</h2>
                        <p>Some of our services are available via subscription plans, paid on a monthly or yearly basis, or unlocked via special promotions.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">PRO Account</h3>
                        <p>
                            The PRO account, available as a subscription plan or as part of a promotion, unlocks extra features compared to the free account. Those features might be updated or enhanced as needed, according to usage and third party
                            dependencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>The monthly or yearly price of the PRO account varies per country and subscription date. The accepted payment currencies are USD, EUR, and GBP.</p>
                        <p>Below you'll find a comparison between PRO and Free:</p>

                        <free-pro-table no-footer="true" />

                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Updates to Subscription Plans</h3>
                        <p>Planned changes to subscription plans will be usually communicated to subscribers at least 14 days in advance.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Cancellation of Subscription Plans</h3>
                        <p>We reserve the right to cancel any existing subscription plans. Cancellation due to legal reasons or external factors, such as changes to the the Strava API, are not guaranteed to be communicated beforehand.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Payment Processing</h3>
                        <p>Subscription payments are primarily handled by a third party service, PayPal. We do not collect, process or store any card or bank details whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Subscriptions paid in form of a Sponsorship via GitHub are handled by Stripe, via GitHub.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Refunds</h3>
                        <p>We do not guarantee refunds by default. Refunds are handled on a per-case basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            Users can request a partial refund of up to 50% of the last subscription payment, if they're not happy with changes made to their subscription plan after the subscription has started. Such requests must be made no later
                            than 30 days after the changes go into production. On exceptional cases, we might offer a partial refund on your last subscription payment for other reasons, if we find it justifiable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of our services are fully dependent on the Strava API, which is a third party service. We cannot guarantee that the Strava API will work or exist at any time in the future. If for any reason Strava decides to disable
                            their API, or in the unlikely event that they decide to cancel our connection to their API, all of our core services will cease to work. In such case, subscribers that had their last payment made in the last 30 days the
                            are entitled to a refund for that last payment alone.
                        </p>
